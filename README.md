## 📖 Algorithm Overview

**DBIG-US** is a two-stage under-sampling method designed for class-imbalanced binary datasets. It does **not** require specifying the number of clusters in advance and lets the user set a maximum imbalance ratio (IR) for the output.

```
Input:  DS = {p1, p2, …, pn},  maxIR
Output: DS_balanced

1. Split DS into C⁻ (majority) and C⁺ (minority)
2. C1⁻ ← C⁻
3. repeat
4.     Compute ε and minPts
5.     C1⁻ ← DBSCAN(C1⁻, ε, minPts)
6. until ε and minPts do not change
7. C2⁻ ← ShapeGraph(C1⁻, Rmax, C⁺)
8. DS_balanced ← C⁺ ∪ C2⁻
```

### Stage 1 — Filtering (DBSCAN)

DBSCAN is applied **only on the majority class** with automatically estimated parameters:

| Parameter | Formula |
|-----------|---------|
| ε | Average Euclidean distance of all majority instances to their centroid |
| minPts | `(π·ε²) / ((4/3)·π·ε³) × |C⁺|` |

Instances identified as **noise are removed** — they are borderline or irrelevant for learning.

### Stage 2 — Under-Sampling (ShapeGraph)

A complete weighted graph `Gw` is built on the noise-free majority class `C1⁻`:
- Vertices = majority instances
- Edge weight = Euclidean distance between instances

The algorithm iteratively picks pairs of instances with **maximum distance** (most dispersed), adding unvisited endpoints to `C2⁻` until `|C2⁻| / |C⁺| ≤ maxIR`.

The target size is reduced using:

```
Sample = (|C1⁻| · σ² · Z²) / (e²·(|C1⁻|−1) + σ²·Z²)
```

with Z=1.96, σ=0.5, e=0.05 (95 % confidence).

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install numpy matplotlib

# Run the demo
python dbig_us.py
```

## 📊 What the Demo Does

1. Generates a synthetic imbalanced dataset (200 majority / 20 minority instances + noise).
2. Applies DBIG-US with `maxIR = 1.5`.
3. Prints majority/minority counts before and after each stage.
4. Saves a side-by-side scatter plot as **`dbig_us_result.png`**.
